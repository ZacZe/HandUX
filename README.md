# Hi. Welcome to this hand-tracking tool. 

## Requirements: 
You must have the following installed: 
- mediapipe (Python)
- OpenCV-Python (Python)
- PYAutoGUI (Python)
- numpy (Python)

## How to Use: 
The cursor is controlled by the movement of the tip of the index finger. 

In order to left click, tap the tip of your thumb with the tip of your index finger. Holding requires touching said tips for a duration of time. 

In order to right click, tap the tip of your thumb with the tip of your middle finger. 

There are plans for there to be settings where you can change the fingers used to do these actions. 

## Extra Features: 
Pressing <code>s</code> will toggle the skeleton of the active hand. This can be used to see how this program registers actions. 

Pressing <code>SPACEBAR</code> will pause or resume the webcam footage. This can be used to temporarily disable this program. 

Pressing <code>ESCAPE</code> will close the program. 

## Future Features: 
These features are currently a work-in-progress and should be implemented soon. 
- Text displaying current gestures and its corresponding action
- Multi-hand tracking for specific or custom actions
- Custom behaviours from specific gestures
- Specific modes for specific activities, eg: drawing or gaming
- Settings to configure specific variables, such as distance threshold and holding threshold
- Settings to change digits used to commit actions
